[Hello World](https://brittdalton.github.io/Creative_Coding_HW/HW_03/Hello_world)

 #### Introduction ####
 Many artists learning to code begin with [processing software](https://processing.org),
 using a JavaScript library [p5.js](https://p5js.org) you can "draw" in a web browser.
 The basic features are familiar tools to create simiple designs; shapes, colors and
 composition.

 #### Sketching with p5.js ####
 To create in p5.js you will need to [download](https://p5js.org/download/) the library and
 set up your directories to work in. After getting set up, it is best to spend some time
 practicing [setup()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/setup) and experimenting with a rendering option such as the [createCanvas()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createCanvas) function.
